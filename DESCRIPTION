Description: This package creates resistance relationship networks, or 'Rnets'. These networks can be used to study relationships between antimicrobial resistances (typically measured using MICs) and genes. IN DEVELOPMENT! Please be patient as we clean up any errors during install and feel free to contact us if you find anything not working as advertised. We'd love to get your feedback!
